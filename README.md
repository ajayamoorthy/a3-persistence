- the goal of the application
- challenges you faced in realizing the application
- what authentication strategy you chose to use and why (choosing one because it seemed the easiest to implement is perfectly acceptable)
- what CSS framework you used and why
  - include any modifications to the CSS framework you made via custom CSS you authored
 
The goal of my application was to build on the existing project from A2 in order to make it a portfolio piece. While developing, the most difficult parts were definitely trying to get the registration page to work because I had to create that from scratch as opposed to index.html, where the starter code provided some help. I chose to use a basic authentication strategy where the username/password checks all occur within my code and not through the use of an external library because I knew I wouldn't have the time to wrangle something like passport.js.

For the CSS framework, I chose to take inspiration from the Bootstrap library but I did all of the CSS myself. As I am interested in full-stack web development as a career, I wanted to try my hand and designing the web app completely. It was difficult and time consuming but the result was pretty solid and visually appealing. With practice, I think I could make some real nice UI in the future.

My Google Lighthouse scores were all over 90, with a majority of them being 100s.

## Technical Achievements
- **Tech Achievement 1**: I used OAuth authentication via the GitHub strategy

### Design/Evaluation Achievements
- **Design Achievement 1**: I followed the following tips from the W3C Web Accessibility Initiative...


Acheivements
---

Below are suggested technical and design achievements. You can use these to help boost your grade up to an A and customize the 
assignment to your personal interests, for a maximum twenty additional points and a maximum grade of a 100%. 
These are recommended acheivements, but feel free to create/implement your own... just make sure you thoroughly describe what you did in your README, 
why it was challenging, and how many points you think the achievement should be worth. 
ALL ACHIEVEMENTS MUST BE DESCRIBED IN YOUR README IN ORDER TO GET CREDIT FOR THEM.

*Technical*
- (10 points) Implement OAuth authentication, perhaps with a library like [passport.js](http://www.passportjs.org/). 
*You must either use Github authenticaion or provide a username/password to access a dummy account*. 
Course staff cannot be expected, for example, to have a personal Facebook, Google, or Twitter account to use when grading this assignment. 
Please contact the course staff if you have any questions about this. THIS IS THE HARDEST ACHEIVEMENT OFFERED IN WEBWARE. You have been warned!  
- (5 points) Instead of Glitch, host your site on a different service like [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com) or [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com). Make sure to describe this a bit in your README. What was better about using the service you chose as compared to Glitch? What (if anything) was worse? 
- (5 points) Get 100% (not 98%, not 99%, but 100%) in all four lighthouse tests required for this assignment.
- (up to 5 points) List up to five Express middleware packages you used and a short (one sentence) summary of what each one does. THESE MUST BE SEPARATE PACKAGES THAT YOU INSTALL VIA NPM, NOT THE ONES INCLUDED WITH EXPRESS. So express.json and express.static don't count here. For a starting point on middleware, see [this list](https://expressjs.com/en/resources/middleware.html).

*Design/UX*
- (10 points) Make your site accessible using the [resources and hints available from the W3C](https://www.w3.org/WAI/), Implement/follow twelve tips from their [tips for writing](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tips/writing/), [tips for designing](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tips/designing/), and [tips for development](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tips/developing/). *Note that all twelve must require active work on your part*. 
For example, even though your page will most likely not have a captcha, you don't get this as one of your twelve tips to follow because you're effectively 
getting it "for free" without having to actively change anything about your site. 
Contact the course staff if you have any questions about what qualifies and doesn't qualify in this regard. 
List each tip that you followed and describe what you did to follow it in your site.
- (5 points) Describe how your site uses the CRAP principles in the Non-Designer's Design Book readings. 
Which element received the most emphasis (contrast) on each page? 
How did you use proximity to organize the visual information on your page? 
What design elements (colors, fonts, layouts, etc.) did you use repeatedly throughout your site? 
How did you use alignment to organize information and/or increase contrast for particular elements. 
Write a paragraph of at least 125 words *for each of four principles* (four paragraphs, 500 words in total).
